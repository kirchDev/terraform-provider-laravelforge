# Security Policy

## Scope

`terraform-provider-laravelforge` is an OpenTofu / Terraform provider that talks to the Laravel Forge API on your behalf. Because it handles **Forge API tokens** and provisions real infrastructure, security issues here can have direct impact on production estates.

While the provider is **pre-1.0**, the supported "version" is the **latest release** (and the tip of `main`). Once it stabilises, supported versions will be listed here.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public GitHub issue for security problems.**

In the context of this provider, a "vulnerability" typically means:

- Leaking the Forge API token (e.g. into logs, state, or error messages beyond what's unavoidable).
- Insecure handling of credentials or secrets in transit.
- A resource that fails to validate input and lets an attacker reach unintended Forge API calls.
- A dependency that introduces a known CVE.

Use one of the following private channels:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred): open a private advisory at <https://github.com/kirchDev/terraform-provider-laravelforge/security/advisories/new>.
2. **Email**: [titus.kirch@kirch.dev](mailto:titus.kirch@kirch.dev). PGP available on request.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Any suggested fix, if you have one.
